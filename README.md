##### Here we go...

Welcome to yet another git profile! Here you will find all sorts of funny scripts. Some work, some don't, and some have stoped being on my todo list so long ago that I believe they have developed a life or their own.

**Hi there!** My name is Diogo and I'm a PhD candidate at the [Max Plank Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics](https://mpe.mpg.de) in Munich, Germany.

My work mostly focuses on the central region of our galaxy and how we can use it, not only to find more about our galaxy's past but also as a laboratory to search for new and exciting physics.
